### üìÇ File Structure

The project is minimalist, focusing on core functionality with three main files:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `index.html` | The main HTML file. It includes the full layout, imports CSS/JS/Libraries, and defines all UI components. |
| `styles.css` | Defines the CSS custom properties for **Light/Dark Mode** themes and base styling, including component transitions and animations. |
| `app.js` | Contains all the core application logic: Firebase initialization, state management, CRUD operations for habits/assignments, rendering functions, and event listeners. |

### üí° Key Code Highlights

#### 1\. Theme Variables (`styles.css`)

The application uses CSS variables for easy theming and supports dark mode via a `[data-theme='dark']` attribute selector on the `<html>` element.

```css
:root { /* Light Theme */
    --background: #f7f9fb;
    --foreground: #0f172a;
    /* ... other variables ... */
}

[data-theme='dark'] {
    --background: #0f172a;
    --foreground: #f8fafc;
    /* ... dark variables ... */
}
```

#### 2\. Habit Progress Calculation (`app.js`)

The daily progress is calculated based on the habits scheduled for today versus the completed habits logged for the current date.

```javascript
const renderDailyProgress = () => {
    // ... logic to get habitsForToday and todayStr ...
    
    // Filter habits scheduled for today
    const habitsForToday = habits.filter(h => 
        h.frequency?.days?.includes('everyday') || h.frequency?.days?.includes(dayOfWeek)
    );
    
    if (habitsForToday.length === 0) { /* ... handle no habits ... */ return; }
    
    const completedCount = habitsForToday.filter(h => 
        habitLogs[todayStr]?.[h.id]?.status === 'completed'
    ).length;
    
    const percentage = Math.round((completedCount / habitsForToday.length) * 100);
    updateProgressCircle(percentage, circle, text);
};
```

#### 3\. Gamification Logic (`app.js`)

XP is granted upon habit completion, and the system automatically handles Level Up logic and updating the user profile in Firestore.

```javascript
const addXP = async (habitId) => {
    const habit = habits.find(h => h.id === habitId);
    if (!habit) return;
    const xpGained = XP_PER_DIFFICULTY[habit.difficulty] || 10;
    
    // ... calculate newXP, newLevel, and xpForNextLevel ...
    
    if (newXP >= xpForNextLevel) {
        newLevel++;
        newXP -= xpForNextLevel;
        showToast(`Level Up! You've reached Level ${newLevel}!`);
    }
    await updateDoc(doc(db, `artifacts/${appId}/users/${userId}/profile/userProfile`), 
        { xp: newXP, level: newLevel });
};
```

### üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-link]
    cd DailyDost
    ```

2.  **Open in Browser:** Open `index.html` directly in your web browser, or use a simple local web server (like VS Code's Live Server extension) due to the use of ES modules and Firebase SDKs.

3.  **Firebase Configuration:** The `app.js` file contains a placeholder `firebaseConfig`. To connect it to your own Firebase project, update these keys:

    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
        projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", // Daily-Dost placeholder
        // ... rest of the config
    };
    ```
